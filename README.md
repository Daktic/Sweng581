# Orangebox

A Cleanflight/Betaflight blackbox log parser written in Python 3.

Orangebox has no dependencies other than the Python standard library, although it might be worthy to investigate
how using `numpy` could possibly bring some performance gain in the future. If so, it shouldn't be a usability barrier
since any user wanting to make something out of the decoded data will more than likely have `numpy` installed
transitively as well as it's also a dependency of libraries like `matplotlib` and `pandas` (among others).

This parser was roughly modeled after the one in [Blackbox Log Viewer](https://github.com/betaflight/blackbox-log-viewer) hence produces the same output.

## Usage (so-called User Guide)

```python3
from orangebox import Parser

# Load a file and select the first log (default)
parser = Parser.load("LOG00042.BFL", 1)

# Print headers
print(parser.headers)

# Print the names of fields
print(parser.field_names)

# Select a specific log within the file by index
parser.set_log_index(2)

# Print field values frame by frame
for frame in parser.frames():
    print(frame.data)

# Complete list of events only available once all frames have been parsed
print(parser.events)
```

## Scripts

The package ships with two utility scripts. `bb2csv` converts a log file into CSV.

```
usage: bb2csv [-h] [-o OUTPUT] [-v] path

positional arguments:
  path                  Path to a blackbox log file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Optional path to an output file (otherwise use standard output) (default: None)
  -v                    Control verbosity (can be used multiple times) (default: 0)
```

`bbsplit` can be used to split a flash chip log (which contains merged logs) into separate files.

```
usage: bbsplit [-h] [-o DIR] [-v] path

positional arguments:
  path                  Path to a blackbox log file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o DIR, --output DIR  Optional path to output directory, defaults to parent directory of the original log file (default: None)
  -v                    Control verbosity (can be used multiple times) (default: 0)
```

## Development tools

You can use `parser_test.py` to test against a CSV file generated by [blackbox-tools](https://github.com/cleanflight/blackbox-tools)
or [Blackbox Log Viewer](https://github.com/betaflight/blackbox-log-viewer). It compares the decoded values to the ones in the CSV file and shows the differences with some additional info.
Please note that `blackbox_decode` and exporting from Blackbox Log Viewer can produce different results.

```
usage: parser_test.py [-h] [-i LOG_INDEX] [-a] [-v] path csv_path

positional arguments:
  path                  Path to a .BFL file
  csv_path              Path to a .CSV file for verification

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i LOG_INDEX, --index LOG_INDEX
                        Log index number (In case of merged input) (default: 1)
  -a, --show-all-fields
                        Show all fields of differing frames (default: False)
  -v                    Control verbosity (can be used multiple times) (default: 0)
```

To profile or measure the parser's execution you can use `parser_benchmark.py` and `parser_profile.py` with a single argument that's a path to a BFL file:

```bash
python3 parser_benchmark.py ~/logs/LOG00042.BFL
```

* Contributions are very welcome!
* Please follow the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) Style Guido.

## Changelog

### 0.2.0

* Improved `Reader` class can now handle multiple logs in a single file
* Add `bbsplit` command-line script for splitting flashchip logs (thanks to Yurii Soldak!)
* Improved logging
* Fix parsing stats

### 0.1.1-beta

* Add `bb2csv` command-line script for converting logs into CSV

### 0.1.0-beta

* First release (with a lot of missing parts)

## Known issues

* No explicit validation of raw data against corruption, missing headers or whatsoever, but it's highly likely that a Python exception will be raised in these cases anyway
* Tested only on logs generated by Betaflight
* No parsing of GPS frames (I don't use it, you're welcome to contribute)
* Not all event frames are parsed (see [TODO](orangebox/events.py) comments)
* Some decoders are missing, possibly related to GPS data (see [TODO](orangebox/decoders.py) comments)
