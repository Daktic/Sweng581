### Identify specific areas or functionalities within your software project that you want to target for exploratory testing.
These areas could include critical user workflows, complex modules, or recently implemented features.

[//]: # (I plan on testing the week3 tests over an extended period of time.)
[//]: # (I will loop the tests on some large number to see what happens.)

### Plan Exploratory Testing Sessions. 
Divide your exploratory testing into multiple sessions, each with a defined duration (e.g., 1 hour per session).
Determine the number of sessions based on the complexity and size of your project.
Aim for a sufficient number of sessions to cover significant functionality.

[//]: # (The Short test will last for 1 hour non-stop)
[//]: # (The Medium test will last for 4 hours non-stop)
[//]: # (The Extended test will last for 12 hours non-stop)

### Test Charter Creation.
For each testing session, create test charters that outline the high-level goals, adopted tour (theme), areas to be explored, and key aspects to focus on during the session.
These charters will guide your testing and help structure your exploration.

[//]: # (High level go is to test what will happen to memory over time.)
[//]: # (The theme is to test the memory usage of the program. Leaks, etc.)
### Execute Exploratory Testing.
Begin each testing session by following the designated test charter.
Actively explore different paths, inputs, edge cases, and error scenarios.
Be attentive to unexpected behaviors, potential defects, and areas of the software that require further investigation.
### Document Findings.
Document your exploratory testing findings, including observed behaviors, unexpected results, potential defects, and suggestions for improvements.
Include relevant artifacts such as screenshots, logs, or video recordings to support your observations.
You may use the template provided in the lesson to document the findings.
