# Week 3
## Design a graph testing model for your project application.


#### Identify a portion of your project that can be tested with graph-based testing.


#### Based on the identified components, create a graph model. The graph model should capture the key decision points, branches, and dependencies of the graph-based components.


#### Select a testing coverage criteria. Make sure to have a rationale for the selected criteria.


#### Based on the selected criteria, generate a set of test cases.


#### Execute the test cases.


#### Document and report any identified issues or defects related to the graph-based components. Provide clear steps to reproduce the issues and include any relevant details or observations from the graph-based testing process.
