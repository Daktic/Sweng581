# Week 2 Testing Questions

### Select a number of testable functions from the code of your application, or features from the application to be tested with the input domain modeling. Make sure to have a good reason for your selection.
The tests.py file contains functions we will be testing. The functions are:
`toint32`, `sign_extend_24bit`, `sign_extend_2bit`, `_trycast`.
The reason for these choices is there ability to be tested with known domain inputs.

### List all of the input variables for the selected set of functions.

### Define the characteristics of the input variables. Make sure you cover all input variables.

### Partition the characteristics into blocks.

### Define values for each block.

### Select the coverage criteria.

### Define a test set that satisfies the selected coverage criteria.

### Execute the test cases on the application and report the results.
